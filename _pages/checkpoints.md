# Checkpoints


There are five checkpoints throughout the semester, at which your Thesis Instructor will critically evaluate your progress and give you a go/no-go for your thesis defense. If you do not show satisfactory work for a given checkpoint, you will have 1 week to get up to speed and you must come to office hours and present your updated progress. 

The checkpoints are the following:

Week 3: List of References, Expanded Outline of Paper

Week 4: Background Section Draft, Calendar of Production

Week 7: Midterm Presentation 

Week 9: Partial Draft 

Week 12: Final Draft
