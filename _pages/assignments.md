Your process website should be updated every week, with links to assignments, as well any other relevant information, such as pictures of project progress.

## Due Week 1:
- Project Pitch Due

	- Be prepared to share a brief (1 page) project pitch with a classmate for peer edit. This may mean bringing in a hard copy, or making a google doc. Also submit a copy to google drive so that I may review. You will be using this pitch to solicit potential advisors for your project.  



## Due Week 2: 

**Class Website Should be Live**

- More guidelines on maintaining your thesis website can be found [here:](https://idmnyu.github.io/MSThesis-Fall2019/_pages/thesis-process-website.html)

**Proposed method + 10 minute method presentation**

- Based on last week’s methodology workshop, identify a methodology AND related methods that makes sense for your project. Prepare a presentation that introduces and gives a brief background on the methodology, and then explain how you plan to apply it to your project. Include any progress made so far.

- You should also note how you imagine sharing your work publicly, as per the new requirement, which is 15% of your grade. Not exhuastive, but please check out these docs with tips for what may be considered [public presentation in different fields](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186AE1ZF2BduXx6XA1o_gJx4tQBvX1qQP8DyVohoFrns/edit?usp=sharing) and this [list of resources for exhibits, conferences, journals, etc.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OIZk3AVwgh4oFYkq5wG2bOZOkDLv-NheBGl0pz0F1Yw/edit?usp=sharing) 

**List of references**

- Choose a citation style and stick with it.  [See this link for more info](https://guides.nyu.edu/citations). 
	
- Submit a Google Doc or Word file with at least 5 references. These can be journal articles, books, essays or websites––but you must have at least 3 that are scholarly publications (books or essays that are critical or theoretical in nature). 

- Annotate each one with a 2-3 sentence description of how this publication informs your work. 
    
For example:
 
"Haraway, D. J. _The companion species manifesto : dogs, people, and significant otherness._

In this essay, Donna Haraway discusses the implosion of nature and culture in the joint lives of dogs and people, who are bonded in 'significant otherness.' This text investigates the notions of co-evolution, and is relevant to my project that aims to design a set of objects for interspecies communication for a speculative but not too distant future. "

Your bibliography should include a diversity of sources, including contemporary publications and "canonical," texts in your field. You should use a mixture of primary and secondary sources, and your sources should be relevant to your topic area. The thoroughness of your final reference section will be a significant factor in your overal paper grade.
