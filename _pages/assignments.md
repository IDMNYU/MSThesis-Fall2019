# Assignments 
Assignments are designed to contribute to your final deliverables, including your final thesis paper, presentation, and project. Certain assignments are associated with [checkpoints](https://idmnyu.github.io/MSThesis-Fall2019/_pages/checkpoints.html)

All assignments are due Mondays at 5pm, uploaded to our shared Google Drive folder (MS-Thesis-Deliverables_yourname) unless specified otherwise. Please make sure NYU users can comment on your assignments.

Your process website should be updated every week, with links to assignments, as well any other relevant information, such as pictures of project progress. More guidelines on maintaining your thesis website can be found [here:](https://idmnyu.github.io/MSThesis-Fall2019/_pages/thesis-process-website.html)

### Week 1:
- Project Pitch Due

	- Be prepared to share a brief (1 page) project pitch with a classmate for peer edit. This may mean bringing in a hard copy, or making a google doc. Also submit a copy to google drive so that I may review. You will be using this pitch to solicit potential advisors for your project.  

	- [Here](link needed) will be a list of pre-approved advisors for MS Thesis. Please peruse this carefully, and look at their work. Send polite, and carefully worded pitches to potential advisors directly.

	- If you have another advisor in mind, send me a note so that I may review their credentials before you contact them. 


### Week 2: 

- Class Website Should be Live

	- More guidelines on maintaining your thesis website can be found [here:](https://idmnyu.github.io/MSThesis-Fall2019/_pages/thesis-process-website.html)

- Proposed method + 10 minute method presentation:

	- Based on last week’s methodology workshop, identify a method that makes sense for your project. Prepare a presentation that introduces and gives a brief background on the methodology, and then explain how you plan to apply this method to your project. Include any progress made so far.
	- You should also note how you imagine sharing your work publicly, as per the new requirement, which is 15% of your grade. (Link to docs needed)

- List of references

	- Submit a Google Doc or Word file with at least 5 references. These can be journal articles, books, essays or websites––but you must have at least 3 that are scholarly publications (books or essays that are critical or theoretical in nature). 

	- Annotate each one with a 2-3 sentence description of how this publication informs your work. 
    
For example:
 
"Haraway, D. J. _The companion species manifesto : dogs, people, and significant otherness._

In this essay, Donna Haraway discusses the implosion of nature and culture in the joint lives of dogs and people, who are bonded in 'significant otherness.' This text investigates the notions of co-evolution, and is relevant to my project that aims to design a set of objects for interspecies communication for a speculative but not too distant future. "
