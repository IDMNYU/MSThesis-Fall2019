# Public Presentation of Your Work

A new requirement we are piloting for MS Thesis Fall 2019! This is designed to ensure that there is a celebratory element to the semester, as well as an opportunity for you to share your work with a broader audience. 

1. You are required to share your work publicly in some manner. An appropriate public presentation may vary, depending on your field. Please see the in the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OIZk3AVwgh4oFYkq5wG2bOZOkDLv-NheBGl0pz0F1Yw) as a reference. 

2. You are required to participate in the public thesis presentation December 16th and 17th. You will have the opportunity to give a 15 minute presentation on your work, and receive 10 minutes of feedback. Simultaneously, your work will be on display at 370 Jay Street. All full-time IDM faculty will be in attendance. Though the time allotted to present your work will be short, you can still make it count!
